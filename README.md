## Program Description
[This script reads five positive integers from the user, stores them in an array, and finds the highest score. It then displays the highest score and shows how much each score differs from it.]

## Usage
To run the script interactively:
```bash
./maxscore.sh
```

To test with the provided input file:
```bash
./maxscore.sh < maxscore-input
```

## How the Script Works
- Reads five numbers from the user and stores them in an array.
- Loops through the array to find the highest score.
- Calculates and displays how much each score differs from the highest.

## Testing Results
[Describe your testing process and results. Include:]
- some example integers are 1-100 and then it tells the differance between them for example if the highest number inputed is 15 and the lowest is 2 the differance is 13
- it iputs those numbers in that file then tells the differance

## Challenges and Solutions
[Optional: Describe any challenges you encountered while creating this script and how you solved them. This could include debugging issues, arrays, or Git workflow problems.]
